# Facebook-Comment-Volume-Dataset

## Summary
#### The goal of this project is to predict the number of comments a Facebook post will receive based on characteristics of the page and information about the post. This pursuit is of great potential value because the number of comments on a Facebook post can be used as a proxy for interest in the subject of the page and relevance of the post’s content. Thus this model to predict the number of Facebook comments based on page and post information, can help gain insight into the thoughts and feelings of people active on social media. This, in turn, be used by advertisers, marketers, as well scientists studying social media.

## EDA
#### To begin the exploration, we examine the category of the source of the document e.g. the place, brand, institution etc. There are total 106 categories. The above ﬁgure (ﬁgure 1) shows the count of each category. Thus we can see which category has the most number of pages and in turn the most number of likes. According to the graph below, we can see that the category number 9 has the most count and it happens to be the professional sports team page

## Implementing diﬀerent models 
### Model 1 : Linear Regression
#### Acoording to the r-square value for this model and also according to the graph, this model cannot be considered for prediction. The value is too small.
